Hello, and welcome to my portfolio. 

I am currently a data scientist at Cavnue specializing in ML/AI & Simulation and have graduated from Duke University where I have received my Masters in Data Science.
I'm currently interested in Bayesian methods, agent based modeling, and software engineering.
Feel free to reach out, and always be learning!
